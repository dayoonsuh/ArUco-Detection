# Live ArUco Marker Detection

This repository contains a Python-based implementation for live detection of ArUco markers using OpenCV. The program captures video from a webcam or other input device, detects ArUco markers in real time, and displays the detected markers along with their IDs on the video feed.

## Features

- Real-time ArUco marker detection
- Identification of marker IDs
- Highlighting of marker boundaries
- Configurable detection parameters
